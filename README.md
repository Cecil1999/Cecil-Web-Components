# Cecil-Web-Components

## Why?

Cecil's Web Components was started because I needed a way to create consistency between my work’s styling and frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind.

As a back-end developer with only a novice understanding of CSS, this project addresses my weakness. To give an example of such weakness, while I use Bootstrap and understand that applying the btn class to `input`, `a`, `div`, or `button` elements will make them look like a Bootstrap button, I wouldn’t be able to list the specific CSS styles needed to achieve that look if asked.

This project is an opportunity for me to hone my CSS skills.

This project also serves as great practice for understanding how to construct web components such as navbars, side menu's, accordions, etc. Should I ever be asked to construct it without a library.

## Should I use it?

I would really _STRONGLY_ recommend that you don't. 

## Could I use it?

Be my guest. I appreciate anyone who would actually consider using this. However, just use Bootstrap or Tailwind instead.

## No Javascript?

I'm going to try strictly using HTML/CSS, as I don't really love working with Javascript.
